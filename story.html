                    We all know that “Verbs” talk about actions. Action Verbs can be
                    further divided into two categories TRANSITIVE VERBS and
                    INTRANSITIVE VERBS.
                    
                    In simple terms, Transitive Verbs are those that take objects and
                    Intransitive Verbs are those that do not take objects. Let us look the
                    following sentences: <br><br>
                    1) I <span style="font-weight: bolder;">bought</span> chocolates.  <br>
                    2) She is <span style="font-weight: bolder;">sleeping.</span> 
                    <br><br>
                    In the first sentences the object “chocolates” is needed to make
                    sense of the verb “bought”. <br>
                    In the second sentence the verb “sleeping” does not need any
                    object to make clear sense. <br><br>
                    Thus, the verb “bought” is a transitive verb and the verb “sleeping”
                    is an intransitive verb.

Yet we hardly think about them because they are such an ordinary part of our daily lives. Shoes were not always an important part of people’s wardrobes. The ancient Greeks, Egyptians, and Persians made and wore sandals, but actually went barefoot most of the time. These people lived in regions where the weather was temperate, and shoes were not needed to keep their feet warm. Archaeologists have found shoes in the ruins of these civilizations",

In ancient Egypt, sandals were made of rushes, which are grassy plants with hollow stalks. Rushes are the same plants used today to make chair bottoms, mats, and baskets.",

                      "Greeks caused the evolution of shoes by making sandals with leather from the hides of animals. The first Greek shoes were purely functional. Over time, the Greeks dyed and decorated their shoes to make fashion statements. Women began to wear soft, enclosed leather shoes, and these grew increasingly fancy in the later years of the Greek civilization.",

                      "In Rome shoemakers often dyed sandals in bright colours that represented the different jobs held by the people wearing them. The patricians, or privileged classes, wore red sandals with moon-shaped ornaments on the back. Senators wore brown shoes with four black leather straps wound around the lower leg. Consuls, or legal officers, wore white shoes, and soldiers wore heavy leather sandals that were more like boots—but with bare toes!",


                      "Meanwhile, people who lived in cold northern climates were making their shoes from the hides of furry animals, such as polar bears and yaks. The soles and tops of these shoes were made from pieces of soft leather sewn together. This type of shoe—whether or not it used fur—was called a moccasin. Some Native American groups made and wore moccasins for thousands of years. Some moccasins were plain, and others were adorned with beadwork.",
